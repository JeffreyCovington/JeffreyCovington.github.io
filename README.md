# Hello!

I am Jeffrey Covington, a Mathematics PhD student at UW-Madison.
I specialize in data assimilation, combining dynamical models and observations to optimally estimate the system state.
My other research interests include statistical control theory and machine learning.
In all of these areas causal structures are vital to building and calibrating the models used for prediction and state estimation.
I hope to continue to do research in academia or industry.
