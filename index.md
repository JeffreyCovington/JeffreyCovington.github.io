# Hello!

I am **Jeffrey Covington**, a Mathematics PhD student at UW-Madison.
I specialize in data assimilation and its applications, combining dynamical models and observations to optimally estimate the system state.
My other research interests include statistical control theory and machine learning.
In all of these areas causal structures are vital to building and calibrating the models used for prediction and state estimation.

I have worked on large projects studying arctic sea ice where I helped develop methods to utilize and reanalyze remote sensing data.
As part of my research I have worked with the Institute for the Foundations of Data Science as a Graduate Research Assistant, applying theoretical data assmilation techniques to high-dimensional and nonlinear real-world applications.
I hope to continue to do applied and theoretical research to advance our understanding of modeling, forecasting, and state estimation.
